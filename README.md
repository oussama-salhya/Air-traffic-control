## Air Traffic Control System

This repository contains the source code for an air traffic control system developed as a university project. The system is designed to manage the movement of aircraft in a simulated airspace, ensuring safe and efficient operations.

### Features

* **Real-time aircraft tracking:** The system tracks the position and altitude of each aircraft in the airspace.
* **Conflict detection and resolution:** The system identifies potential conflicts between aircraft and provides instructions to avoid them.
* **Route planning and optimization:** The system calculates optimal routes for aircraft to minimize delays and fuel consumption.
* **Communication with pilots:** The system allows controllers to communicate with pilots via text messages and voice chat.
* **Data visualization:** The system provides a graphical interface for controllers to visualize the airspace and aircraft movements.

### Technologies

The system is built using the following technologies:

* **Java** 
* **Spring Boot**
* **Spring Data JPA**
* **MySQL** 
* **HTML**
* **CSS** 
* **JavaScript**
  
### Getting Started

To run the system, you will need to:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the required dependencies.
3. Start the MySQL database.
4. Run the Spring Boot application.
